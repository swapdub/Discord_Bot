# Discord Music bot
This is my version of a Discord Bot built to play Music. 

## Option 1
To use this code for your own bot follow the steps below if you have Python installed:

- Download this repository. 
- Extract the contents.
- Install dependencies from <strong> requirements.txt </strong>
- Paste the token for your bot in the variable "my_secrets" at the top of main.py file.
<br> 
(You can find your token in the dev pages on discord.com)
- Run the file main.py


## Option 2
I have my code with my bot's Token on Repl.it <br>

To add my bot to your server click on the link below: 
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=730602425807011847&permissions=8&scope=

Feel free to run my bot using this link from repl.it and click play:
https://replit.com/@swapdub/DiscordBot#main.py

This allows you to run the bot on their server without having to download anything on your device. It runs in the browser and can be used and viewed by anyone.


In-Progress Features and Known Bugs:

- Queue out of index when cleared or next enough times
- No seek for now playing music yet
- Bot sends too many reply messages, need to change that to editable embeds for better visuals
